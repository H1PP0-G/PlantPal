##  About The Project

PlantPal is a clean, user-friendly front-end web application designed to solve the common challenges faced by plant lovers. It allows users to visually monitor the watering and sunlight status of each plant, log care activities, and ensure their green companions receive the best possible care.

This project serves as a practical assessment for the **ISYS3001 - Managing Software Development** course. It is not only a functional application but also a comprehensive showcase of modern software development management practices, including version control, branching strategies, continuous integration, and procurement management.

##  Configuration Management & Workflow

This project adheres to a systematic configuration management plan and development workflow to ensure code quality and team collaboration.

*   **Version Control:** Uses **Git** for distributed version control, with **GitHub** as the remote repository for hosting and collaboration.
*   **Branching Model:** Implements a **simplified Git Flow model**.
    *   `main`: The production branch, containing the most stable, deployable code.
    *   `develop`: The integration branch for features. All feature branches are merged here for testing.
    *   `feature/PP-<Jira-ID>-<desc>`: Branches for developing new features, linked to Jira task IDs.
*   **Commit Convention:** Follows the **Conventional Commits** specification. The format `type: subject` (e.g., `feat: Add plant status UI`) is used to maintain a clear and readable commit history.
*   **Code Review:** All merges into the `develop` and `main` branches must be done through a **Pull Request (PR)**. PRs require review and approval from at least one other team member to ensure code quality.

---

##  Roadmap

*   [ ] Implement a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
*   [ ] Introduce a back-end service for user authentication.
*   [ ] Persist plant data in a database.
*   [ ] Add more care reminders (e.g., fertilizing, repotting).
